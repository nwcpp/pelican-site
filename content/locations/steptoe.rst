Our meetings are held at the
`main Microsoft campus <{filename}/images/MicrosoftMainCampusMap.jpg>`_,
in the Steptoe Room, `Cafeteria 40 <https://www.google.com/maps/place/Microsoft+Cafe+40/>`_,
at the corner of NE 31st and 156th Ave NE, in Redmond, WA.

The cafeteria lies between Building 40 and Building 41.
The Steptoe Room is at the south end of the cafeteria,
close to the main entrance of Building 40.

As you turn off NE 31st St, you will see building 41 on your left
and a large parking structure on your right. Park there.
If you arrive after 6pm, you won't need to register with Microsoft as a visitor.

Usually, we meet at 7pm on the *third Wednesday* of the month.
Come about 6:45pm for pizza.

*Note*: You may need to knock on the window so that we can let you into the building.
