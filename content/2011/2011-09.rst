Abstract
~~~~~~~~

A stroll through actor and task based programming using Visual Studio.

Developing concurrent applications and libraries is hard.
Making them robust and inherently scalable is even more challenging.
This talk will walk through a small handful of examples of using Microsoft's
`Agents <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492627(VS.100).aspx>`_
& `Parallel Pattern Library <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492418(VS.100).aspx>`_
that implement patterns from actor-based and dataflow programming.
An emphasis will be made on providing examples that are drawn from real situations
I've encountered in code in the last few years
and how the patterns help resolve them,
rather than just providing a simple inventory of the APIs.
