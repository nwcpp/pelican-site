Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Debuggers are an important tool for helping software engineers
get to the root of certain problems.
`Mago <http://dsource.org/projects/mago_debugger>`_ 
is a graphical debugger dedicated to the
`D programming language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)>`_
on Windows.
It is made up of several independent libraries that can be used
for other purposes such as tracing and code analysis.

In this talk, we'll cover the process of debugging in general,
specifics on Windows, and details about Mago's connection to D.
