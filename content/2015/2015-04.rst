Abstract
~~~~~~~~

It is not uncommon to see projects using C++ Code Generation to build initial .h and .cpp files out of UML models, or serialization/marshalling code for data types. However there are further potential applications in aspect orientation, performance tracking, and various types of testing. In a world where developers are expected to become more and more agile, it is more important than ever to hunt down things that are automatable and this talk can give you some ideas.
