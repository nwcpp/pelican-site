Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This presentation will illustrate techniques to ensure code correctness
at compile time, extend the STL, and enhance C++ using the freely
available and portable boost libraries,
`www.boost.org <http://www.boost.org>`_. Beginning with brief overviews
of the boost organization and the boost libraries, we will then explore
ten specific boost libraries, covering the why’s, what’s, and how’s
behind the concepts that enable all three of the techniques listed
above.

This presentation assumes familiarity with C++ templates.
