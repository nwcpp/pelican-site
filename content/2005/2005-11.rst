Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Is it possible to have the power and efficiency of C++,
but in a much easier to use form?
Walter will contrast C++ and D
and show how, with D, one can achieve the same or better results
with much less complexity and with greater reliability,
without sacrificing performance.

Bio
~~~

Walter Bright's first major program was the groundbreaking wargame Empire.
He then became interested in compilers and computer languages.
He's written compilers for ABEL, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Javascript, and now D.
His extensive experience writing C++ compilers
and well over a decade being on the front lines of doing C++ customer support
is an ideal background for improving on the language.
