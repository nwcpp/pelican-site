Abstract
~~~~~~~~

One of the big problems in software development
is that a lot of energy is spent on understanding existing code,
whether it was written by other programmers or by the current developer long time ago.
Bartosz will argue that a large part of code analysis can be automated
using exotic new techniques inspired by biology, cellular automata,
document processing, and more.

Bio
~~~

Bartosz is a theoretical physicist turned programmer.
He is the author of the book, *C++ In Action*, published by Addison-Wesley in 2001.
He founded `Reliable Software LLC <http://www.relisoft.com>`_ in 1996
to get first-hand experience in creating and maintaining
a large software project—a version-control system called Code Co-op.
Studying complexity is his main interest.
