Abstract
~~~~~~~~

With the increase of processor clock speeds hitting a snag,
we're facing yet another silent revolution
in processor architecture and programming style.
Forget about writing lousy, inefficient code and
then taking six months off to let Moore's law catch up.
Once again the heydays of efficient code are up,
and with the new multicore, massively parallel architectures,
threads are the way to go.
This talk presents the newest, hottest, and most addictive multithreaded technique in town:
lock-free programming.
