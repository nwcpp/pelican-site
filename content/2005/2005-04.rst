Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Another C++ regular expression library? Hasn't it all been done? No!

xpressive pushes the boundaries of compile-time and run-time interaction.
Regular expressions can be written either as a string to be parsed at runtime,
or as an expression template parsed (and optimized!) at compile time.
In this talk, Eric will discuss library design at the compile-time/run-time boundary,
and the interesting possibilities such a design makes possible.
