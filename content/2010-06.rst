Abstract
~~~~~~~~

GigaFlops or… TerraFlops?
The modern GPU is a massively parallel supercomputer
that has 2 orders of magnitude more processing power than a single CPU Core.
But the threading model is very different than the CPU.
Don’t get left behind on knowing about this different paradigm.

Bio
~~~

Gavriel Plotke, Microsoft Senior SDET.
I've been with Microsoft for 3 years on the DirectX High Level Shader Language compiler test team.
I’ve been a champion of the new Compute Shader features of DirectX11.
While I have some graphics background,
it was my assembler language and compiler writing background that got me the job.
Early in my career I worked on the internals of
a mainframe spreadsheet product as a competitor to VisiCalc and Lotus123.
It was a time when everyone in a big office would have a mainframe terminal and
no one had a PC.
It was a great product, but time moved on, and Excel on inexpensive PCs ate our lunch.
After that I spent many years doing business contract work
— different projects, different platforms, lots of database design.
Now I help support programming on today’s supercomputer, the modern graphics card.
