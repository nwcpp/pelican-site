Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Microsoft Visual Studio 7 .NET has shipped with improved support for
ANSI C++. The whole .NET aspect of this tool, discussed extensively in
this and other forums, is radically new and at first blush is
incompatible with ANSI C++, native code COM objects, etc. This talk will
address some of the aspects of how Microsoft proposes to bridge the gap
between existing source code, COM objects, etc. and executables using
the new suite of .NET technologies, in particular using the ‘Managed
C++’ syntax.

Bio
~~~

Matthew Griscom has coded medical communications protocols, database
integrity tools, a multi-user database engine, XSL-driven web pages, you
name it, for both Unix and Windows. Now, if only one of the cosmonauts
on the Space Station would push the button to use the connectivity
software he designed and wrote, that would be sincerely cool… Matt’s
been dot-bombed and is looking for C++ and .NET work in greater Seattle.
