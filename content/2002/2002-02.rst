Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Microsoft Visual Studio .NET will ship in the coming weeks (at least
they say so) and everybody is talking about C#, VB, ASP, and ADO. What
about C++? How does it fit with new technologies? We will explore a
closer look at the new features of the compiler, the C Run-Time, and
three other libraries, namely STL, MFC and ATL.

Bio
~~~

Christian has come a long way from DOS to Unix and now to MS Windows (as
well as from Germany to Seattle!). Currently he works for Saxonia
Systems, a software consulting company based out of Dresden, Germany.
Besides his duties heading up Saxonia's U.S. consulting division in C++
programming, he is constantly keeping an eye on the market for new and
useful programming tools.
