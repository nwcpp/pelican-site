Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This talk presents a couple of new, safe idioms that bring order in your
C++ multithreaded programs. We will cover three idioms for single-object
transactions and two idioms for multi-object transactions, with
examples. Warning: This talk is rated R for (C++) language abuse,
violence (of debate), and subliminal content.
