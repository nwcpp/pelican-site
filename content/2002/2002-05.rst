Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This talk sets out many of the parameters that are recurrent when
programming small- to moderately-sized embedded systems in C++. It then
delves into C++ techniques to work within the resource-limited,
cost-sensitive, required-robustness confines of embedded systems. These
techniques are also useful when building PC applications.

Bio
~~~

Robert Blumberg has over 35 years of programming experience, having
started by programming on IBM 7090 mainframes. As an executive, he has
been the director of Engineering at Bitstream and a VP of a speech
recognition company among other posts. However, he really enjoys
throwing C++ code, which he has been doing as a freelance programmer for
the last fifteen years or so, mostly for embedded systems and drivers.
Among other projects, he designed and coded the kernel, drivers and
coin-movement software for Coinstar’s big green coin-counting machines
often found in super markets.
