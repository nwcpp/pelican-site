Abstract
~~~~~~~~

At GDC 2005, Chris Hecker stated that average game code
is going to run slower on next-generation consoles than on the current generation.
In many ways, he’s right.
Programmers accustomed to having CPU silicon
devoted to out-of-order execution units and instruction pipelining
are in for a rude awakening.
A few brave souls will turn to assembly language optimizations,
but what about the rest of us who use C++ on a daily basis?
This talk is for you.
Find out how to write C++ code that runs like a dream on next-generation consoles.

Bio
~~~

Pete has been programming in the game industry for 10 years.
He has shipped titles ranging from adventure stories to online games,
working on everything from Macs to consoles.
He is currently a lead engineer with the Xbox Advanced Technology Group.
He has a degree in computer engineering
and was a C++ template geek long before compilers knew what to make of functors and traits.
