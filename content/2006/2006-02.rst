The Phoenix Compiler and Tools Framework: Built From, Building, and Building On C++/CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Phoenix, Microsoft's next generation compiler and tools framework,
is built entirely in C++/CLI.
Phoenix's design leverages both the traditional strengths of C++
and the innovative features of CLI binding.
The Phoenix framework's flexible, and extensible components
make extensive use of CLI features like ref classes, properties, events, and delegates.
We'll demonstrate how C++/CLI enables Phoenix
to produce not only powerful compiler and jit components
that will help implement and optimize C++/CLI programs
but also produce novel and efficient tools for
C++/CLI program analysis, understanding, and manipulation.
