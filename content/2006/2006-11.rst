Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Time constraints and demands for breadth constrain academic instruction.
Job experience fills in the gap between theory and practice.
Here we discuss some circumvented hurdles
(representation, resource management, failures)
as well as key characteristics of students who succeed as professionals.
