Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Traditionally, memory allocation is approached as a monolithic, rigid design
influenced by a performance-minded implementation.
However, compile-time C++ techniques can yield
a highly flexible and configurable design
with the same performance profile
as equivalent hand-implemented designs.
This talk describes work by Emery Berger and others
who have designed and implemented a policy-based allocator.
