Abstract
~~~~~~~~

High-level languages insulate the programmer from the machine.
That’s a wonderful thing—except when it obscures the answers
to the fundamental questions of
“What does the program do?” and “How much does it cost?”

The C++/C#/Java programmer is less insulated than most,
and still we find that programmers are consistently surprised
at what simple code actually does and how expensive it can be—\
not because of any complexity of a language,
but because of being unaware of the complexity
of the machine on which the program actually runs.

This talk examines the “real meanings” and “true costs” of the code we write and run
especially on commodity and server systems, 
by delving into the performance effects of bandwidth vs. latency limitations,
the ever-deepening memory hierarchy,
the changing costs arising from the hardware concurrency explosion,
memory model effects all the way from the compiler
to the CPU to the chipset to the cache, and more—\
and what you can do about them.

Bio
~~~

Herb Sutter is a software architect at Microsoft
and chair of the ISO C++ standards committee.
Among his books and papers on software development
is the widely-cited article "The Free Lunch Is Over"
where he coined the title phrase and "concurrency revolution"
as applied to describe the software sea change
now in progress to exploit increasingly parallel hardware
