Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Designing your own programming language is fun!
It can also increase the expressiveness of your code.
But did you know that you can host your little languages right in C++?
Libraries like Boost.Spirit and the Lambda Library
do just that with the help of templates and operator overloading.
Come learn how you can easily create your own mini language-in-a-library, too.
We'll talk about Boost.Proto,
a new library that takes the pain out of working with expression templates.
