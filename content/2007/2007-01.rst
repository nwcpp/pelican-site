Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This talk assumes you're bored with the usual macguffins—\
expressions, statements, and core strings vs library strings.
We'll skip right to the naughty bits—\
lambdas, mixins, tuples, scope guards, lazy arguments, and static if's.
What are they, and what they are good for, will be explored.

Bio
~~~

Walter Bright's first major program was the groundbreaking wargame Empire.
He then became interested in compilers and computer languages.
He's written compilers for ABEL, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Javascript, and now D.
His extensive experience writing C++ compilers
and well over a decade being on the front lines of doing C++ customer support
is an ideal background for improving on the language.
