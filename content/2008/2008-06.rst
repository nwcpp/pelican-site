Abstract
~~~~~~~~

What is a memory model and why does C++ need it so badly?
I'll try to explain both the practical and the theoretical side of things.
We'll look into a few simple multithreaded idioms,
sketch the Java memory model,
and show the differences between Java and C++.
For the theoretically minded, I'll do my best to explain sequential consistency
and the "happens before" relationship necessary to describe data races.
We'll look into the C++ atomic library.
