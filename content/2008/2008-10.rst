Abstract
~~~~~~~~

An introduction to the Standard Library and Concepts in C++0X.
A general overview, and a couple of in-depth analyses of
how to understand and use this new feature of the language.

Bio
~~~

Programming since '74, using C++ since '87.
Gary has been one of the early abusers of the C++ language and compiler
to twist it to make functional programing a reality.
A technical consultant and volunteer to the C++ standards committee since 2001
where he has worked with many others on getting
"bind", "variadac templates", "lambda", "decl\_type"
and other useful stuff into the C++0X standard.
A Google search of ``"Gary Powell" C++`` will yield a large number of hits
only a few of which are not him.
