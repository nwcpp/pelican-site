Abstract
~~~~~~~~
Back in 2008 or so we got our first introduction to move constructors that were coming with the C++0X standard.  However, our compilers didn't support it yet.  Then later when our compilers did support it, we weren't allowed to use the "new-fangled" features yet.  Now that C++11 is in mainstream, let's take another look at move constructors.  Why would you use them, when would you use them, how would you use them, and how do they actually work under the hood?  What is this '&&' thing which does not mean logical and?
