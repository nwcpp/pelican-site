Abstract
~~~~~~~~
The Curse of Knowledge is a cognitive bias where a highly skilled person unknowingly assumes that others have the required background to understand a given topic. But what happens when a group of intelligent, like-minded, software engineers design a library? This talk will compare and contrast library designs with an emphasis on how we can use the power of D to improve the usability of our libraries. This exploration of library design will culminate with a discussion of how well designed libraries can be used to rapidly construct the services that businesses rely on. While the examples are given in D, this presentation is applicable to anyone who builds or maintains libraries in any language.
