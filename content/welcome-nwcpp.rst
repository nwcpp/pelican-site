The Northwest C++ Users' Group (NWCPP) is a group of professional developers and hobbyists
living and working in the Pacific Northwest
who meet monthly to discuss trends, techniques, and technology
regarding the C++ language and industry.
The group meetings and resources are free, and anyone and everyone is welcome to attend.

We are interested in C++, C, the D language, concurrency, scalability,
performance, Boost, software engineering, design patterns, debugging,
compilers, tools, functional programming, software architecture,
machine architecture, DSLs, embedded software, test-driven development,
cross-platform development, distributed programming, and more.
