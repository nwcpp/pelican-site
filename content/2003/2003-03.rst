Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Everybody knows the adage "Resource acquisition is initialization."
Not many people know that this simple principle gave rise to the whole
methodology of Resource Management (RM).
Bartosz will try to convince us that RM is better than garbage collection.
He will describe auto\_vector
— a simpler alternative to a vector of reference-counted smart pointers
(which will most likely become part of the new C++ Standard).
He will also talk about his personal favorite: using RM in Windows (non-MFC) programming.
