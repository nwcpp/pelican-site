Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Attend this talk to learn about Mojo, the new framework, library, and
coding guideline that enables you to pass and return values without
fearing that copying temporaries is going to ruin runtime performance or
your code review. Mojo guarantees that, if you follow a number of simple
rules when designing your classes, you will totally eliminate
unnecessary copying.

Learn about Mojo from its own creator for 90 fun and instructive
minutes. Mojo uses a cornucopia of interesting tricks and techniques
that are likely to make your day whether you use C++ (you'll be happy
you can apply them) or other languages (you'll be happy you can't apply
them).
