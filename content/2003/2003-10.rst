Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Traditional procedural approach to thread programming is to create a
thread and pass it a function to execute. But a function operates on
data. The data is most likely shared with other threads. In the
object-oriented world data comes first. You create an ActiveObject whose
state develops asynchronously. There is a captive thread inside an
Active Object, but it's only an implementation detail.

I will describe a C++ implementation of Active Object using Windows API
and I will discuss multiple uses of ActiveObject in our own commercial
product, including various synchronization techniques.

A similar concept in Java is called the Runnable interface.
