Abstract
~~~~~~~~

In October 2003, a new ECMA standards committee was formed to create an
international standard for "C++/CLI," a set of C++ extensions for .NET
programming designed by Microsoft in collaboration with C++ industry
leaders as a successor to "Managed C++."
Formally, C++/CLI is a binding between ISO C++ and ISO CLI
(Common Language Infrastructure, the standardized subset of
the .NET runtime environment and frameworks class library);
see the announcement at
`www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-TG5-PR.htm
<http://www.ecma-international.org/news/ecma-TG5-PR.htm>`_.

In this talk, the lead architect of C++/CLI talks about the language
design and major features, with a look under the hood at how compilers
are implementing the new semantics. C++/CLI provides first-class and
cleanly integrated support in the C++ language for all .NET features
(e.g., properties and events, garbage collection and generics) uniformly
for all types including also for native types. It also provides
first-class support on the .NET platform for all standard C++ features
(e.g., deterministic destruction and templates) uniformly for all types,
including also for .NET types. These facilities are expressed through a
set of pure conforming extensions, underpinned by a unified type system
and unified pointer/storage system.
