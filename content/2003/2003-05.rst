Abstract
~~~~~~~~

*The Bizarro World of hetero\_stack, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying
and Love RTTI, or Alignment, Exceptions and Type-Safety, Oh My! or
Subverting the C++ Type System for Fun and Profit.*

hetero\_stack is a dynamic replacement for the program stack. Push
anything! Pop anything! I'll talk about how to make it work and how to
make it type-safe and exception-safe. (I might even say a few words
about why you might want to do such a thing.) We'll cover alignment,
runtime time info and the strong exception guarantee, time permitting.
This talk assumes knowledge of templates and exceptions, but nothing too
esoteric.
