Abstract
~~~~~~~~

We are very fortunate to have Scott Meyers come to speak with us this
month. Scott of course is the author of "Effective C++" and "More
Effective C++", generally acclaimed as two of the most important books
ever written about C++. Every C++ developer should be familiar with
these books. Scott is a highly sought-after speaker and we are grateful
that he has come to speak to us.

Our meeting will be a world-premiere of Scott's material on STL (the
standard template library)!

Scott's description of his talk, presented verbatim:
 "For the past 18 months, Scott Meyers has been exploring the STL, and
on April 30 he sends to his publisher the results of his efforts, the
new book, Effective STL: 50 Specific Ways to Improve Your Use of the
Standard Template Library. In this talk, Scott presents two or three
Items from this new book, items that focus on material not usually
covered in descriptions of the STL. He also hands out flyers for the new
book and urges everyone to buy their usual minimum of three copies: one
for the office, one for home, and one for each of your cars (for when
you're stuck in traffic)."
