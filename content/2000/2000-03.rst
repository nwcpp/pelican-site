Abstract
~~~~~~~~

There is a lot you may need to consider when designing a C++ class
including ease of use, reusability, extensibility, and portability,
etc.. All of these considerations may suffer because of the real-world
pressures of time and money. Mark will talk about C++ class design using
two classes from recent projects, a password generation class and a
class for searching disks for specific files.
