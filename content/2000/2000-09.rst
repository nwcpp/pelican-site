Abstract
~~~~~~~~

This talk presents the subtle issues associated with writing correct
code in the presence of exceptions. Writing exception-safe code is a
must for preserving the sanity of any application. This task is daunting
because exceptions introduce hidden control flows and require a modified
way of thinking. Several approaches to exception safety are discussed on
a concrete example, with their advantages and drawbacks. In the end an
useful helper class template ScopeGuard is introduced, that enables you
to write exception-safe code that's terse, easy to understand, and easy
to maintain.

“I presented this to someone who hadn't worked with exceptions, and in
the end he said: ‘Cool. Exceptions are not hard, supporting them is
trivial. Do they all do it this way?’ He was surprised to hear that most
programmers do it the hard way and that ScopeGuard is cutting-edge.”
