Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Metaprograms are programs that output other programs.
They can greatly increase the expressive power of a language.
Familiar metaprogramming languages are the C text preprocessor and C++ templates.
Walter will show how some simple language features
like string mixins and compile time function execution
can lead to powerful metaprogramming facilities,
with examples in the D programming language.
