C++: Building scalable applications in Visual Studio 2010 with the Concurrency Runtime and Parallel Pattern Library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this talk, we'll do a deep dive of the Concurrency Runtime
and the Parallel Libraries built on top of them,
and talk about what's new since the Visual Studio 2010 CTP.
We'll provide a hands on look at how to use the Parallel Pattern Library
and the Asynchronous Agents Library together
to express parallelism and maintain responsiveness in applications.
We'll discuss how to use the Concurrency Runtime
to manage multiple scheduler instances within an application,
how to extend the Concurrency Runtime itself for additional programming models,
and how to fulfill quality of service requirements with the Resource Manager.
Finally we'll talk about how the Concurrency Runtime
takes advantage of the new Windows 7 functionality,
User Mode Scheduled Threads and support for > 64 processors,
to enable additional scalability on the Windows Platform.

The presentation will be given by members of the Concurrency Runtime team:
Dana Groff, Don McCrady and Rick Molloy.
