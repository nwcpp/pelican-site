Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The Concurrency and Coordination Runtime (CCR)
provides developers an easy way to create and coordinate
loosely-coupled, data-driven applications.
It is one of the core building blocks of Microsoft Robotics Developer Studio
but has applications far beyond robotics.
CCR provides a message-passing architecture with powerful orchestration primitives
enabling the coordination of data and work.

Bio
~~~

Andreas is a Senior Engineer in the Microsoft Robotics Group,
where he works on CCR, DSS, and the Visual Programming Language.
Prior to joining Microsoft,
he worked on telecommunication and interactive television products
and was a Research Assistant at Technische Universtitaet Berlin in Germany.
