Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Compilers are a fundamental tool for programmers.
Knowing how they work enables a much more effective use of them.
This presentation covers how they work—\
the various passes like lexing, parsing semantic analysis,
optimization, and code generation—\
and how they fit together to transform source code into executable code.
