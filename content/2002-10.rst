Abstract
~~~~~~~~

From exception specifications to export, from typedef templates to
typeof to delegating constructors, this talk analyzes current C++
features that you should use with care if at all, and important new
C++0x language features coming soon to a compiler near you. It shows why
the features are useful, where they have areas or effects that can be
dangerous or result in unintended effects, what kinds of coding idioms
and techniques they make possible, when you can expect them to be stable
in shipping compilers, who the people and companies behind them are, and
how you can use them safely and effectively.

Talk first given at `The C++ Seminar <http://www.thecppseminar.com>`_
