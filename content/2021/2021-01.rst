Title
~~~~~
Integrating Reusable C++ Code in R Packages

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
One of the most time-consuming, tedious, and thankless tasks a quantitative developer frequently confronts is writing interfaces to C++ code from other languages such as Excel VBA, Python, and R. Fortunately, this process has been made far less painful when interfacing to a front-end in R, thanks to the Rcpp R package.

The open source Rcpp package was first developed about ten years ago. It has since evolved significantly in terms of providing a platform for rapid development, plus convenient build and documentation tools, all integrated into the RStudio IDE.  Rcpp represents a major breakthrough in allowing a programmer to farm out computationally-intensive tasks to C++, return the results to R, and then use these results within other R functions, including Râ€™s powerful data visualization tools. Although there is a fair amount of documentation available on using Rcpp, there does not seem to be much written on how to ensure a clean separation between the R interface and the C++ code.

In this presentation, we will discuss how to set up an R package project in RStudio, develop C++ interfaces with Rcpp, and then call standard C++ code that remains reusable for other applications, all with minimal fuss.
