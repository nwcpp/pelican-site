Abstract
~~~~~~~~

You are stranded on a desert island. All you have is a piece of shared
memory and a waitable timer. You are supposed to implement robust
inter-process communications in C++. Bartosz will explain the concept of
shared memory in Win32 and its use in establishing a protocol for data
exchange between processes. It's better than DDE and simpler than COM.
