Title
~~~~~
Avoiding Code Smells

Abstract
~~~~~~~~
I've been writing code for over 40 years. One thing that comes with
experience is one develops a nose for code smells. When you're asked
to help someone find a bug in their code, you can often just glance
at it and get a pretty good idea where to hone in on where the error
is likely lurking.

How is this possible in a large code base? It turns out that the human
brain is a very good pattern matcher, and by experience one learns
to recognize what code looks like that has bugs in it, i.e. it smells.
Sometimes, though, it is hard for the person to say just what it is
that triggers the smell, just that it stinks. I've tried to distill
out what those characteristics are.

Inevitably, since this is based on my own personal experience, it
is a highly personal list. Many you've surely heard before, I hope there
will be some you haven't recognized yet. Will eliminating smells actually
result in bug-free code? Maybe that's too much to hope for, but I bet
we get a lot closer to it.
