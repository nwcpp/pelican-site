Open Discussion: Chatting on ChatGPT

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
Generative AI is all the rage right now, in particular ChatGPT. Come join us for a lively open
discussion and hopefully some live demos of this emerging technology. What is it, how does it work,
what can you do with it, how much of a threat is it?
