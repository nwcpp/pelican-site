Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Are you using the Visual Studio Debugger or Profiler
to diagnose issues in  applications?
Join the Visual Studio team for a roadmap and discussion
of diagnostics features for C++ developers
in the preview releases of Visual Studio “14” and beyond.
In this session we will demo the brand new and exciting capabilities
that we have added to the debugger
and the Performance and Diagnostics hub (profiler tools)
to increase your productivity.
We will then share our plans for moving forward
and solicit feedback from you to help us shape Visual Studio.

No Video Recording
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

THIS SESSION WILL NOT BE RECORDED.
It will include material which our speakers have opted to NOT have recorded,
as it is of a “non-public nature” at this time.
Because of this we will NOT be recording this session as we normally do,
so please plan to attend in person if you are interested in this topic.
We record as many sessions as possible,
but at the same time,
we also respect the speakers' wishes to control
how the material they present is distributed.
Thanks for your understanding, and sorry for the late notice on this change.
