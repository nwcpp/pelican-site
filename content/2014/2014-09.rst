Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Parallelism in C++ has become more accessible
thanks to the plethora of libraries developed by the industry in the last decade or so.
The time has come to bring the innovations developed in these libraries into the mainstream
– the ISO C++ Standard.
In this talk we’ll dive into a couple of proposals that are currently on the agenda
for the next major version of the C++ Standard
– the Task Regions and the Parallel STL.
Together, these proposals aim to make writing portable parallel code in C++
easy and productive.

Bio
