Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Static analysis is a technique for finding bugs without running the code.
This presentation will examine the technical problems of analyzing millions of lines of code,
the philosophical problems of answering the question “what is a bug anyway?”
and the psychological problems of explaining bugs to a skeptical audience.
