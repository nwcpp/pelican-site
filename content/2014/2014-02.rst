Please welcome a speaker panel from Amazon Global Inventory Platform
as our speakers this month!
We are going to do something a bit different this month.
Rather than have one speaker we are going to do a series of “lightning rounds”
where each speaker will present a short case study.
Food for this meeting is being sponsored by Amazon GIP.

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The Amazon Global Inventory Platform team will be presenting
a set of case studies showing data structure comparisons
between C++ vs. Java implementations.
The presentation will be in the form of a set of “lightning rounds”
with each round lasting between 10 and 15 minutes.
We’ll have a different speaker and data structure for each round.

Bio
~~~

Amazon’s Global Inventory Platform team
is responsible for the Supply Chain systems that support Amazon.com inventory worldwide.
Given that our volume doubles in size roughly every 3 years,
our team must always be at the forefront of research
into new technologies, machine learning techniques, big data analysis,
and complex forecasting models
to more accurately and efficiently have items on their way to customers
before they ever even click “buy”.
We’re predicting the future and changing it, every day.
