Bio
~~~

Amazon’s Global Inventory Platform team
is responsible for the Supply Chain systems that support Amazon.com inventory worldwide.
Given that our volume doubles in size roughly every 3 years,
our team must always be at the forefront of research
into new technologies, machine learning techniques, big data analysis,
and complex forecasting models
to more accurately and efficiently have items on their way to customers
before they ever even click “buy”.
We’re predicting the future and changing it, every day.
