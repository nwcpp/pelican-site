Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Writing loops over sequences is harder in C++ than in other languages,
many of which provide a dedicated ``for_each`` looping construct.
In this talk, Eric describes how to implement and use
a generic, type-safe and extensible foreach construct in C++
with the help of the preprocessor and some sneaky template tricks.
The techniques, first presented in the Nov. C/C++ Users' Journal,
are extended to work with STL containers.
Time permitting, Eric will describe why ``std::for_each`` doesn't cut it,
and why we need a language extension.
