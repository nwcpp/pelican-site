Abstract
~~~~~~~~

The D Programming Language is the result of many years of experience
with compilers and languages, especially C++.
C++ is a powerful, groundbreaking language.
D comes from looking at what works in C++, what doesn't work,
and refactoring the language to take advantage of hindsight
in how things can work better.
D adds in proven capabilities from other modern languages that are sorely missed in C++.
This talk is an overview of D—what it is, why it is that way,
and how it works out in practice.

Bio
~~~

Walter Bright's first major program was the groundbreaking wargame Empire.
He then became interested in compilers and computer languages.
He's written compilers for ABEL, Pascal, C, C++, Java, Javascript, and now D.
His extensive experience writing C++ compilers
and well over a decade being on the front lines of doing C++ customer support
is an ideal background for improving on the language.
