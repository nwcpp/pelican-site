Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This will be an informal discussion over dinner.
The topic is just a suggestion,
and we may find that we prefer to socialize rather than discuss anything in particular.
Come ready to chat and get to know your fellow NWCPP members.
If you plan on eating, please bring money for food and drinks.
