Since May 2011, TypeMock has given away two copies of
`Isolator++ <http://www.typemock.com/isolatorpp-product-page>`_
at each NWCPP meeting.

Isolator++ enables easy unit testing of even the most problematic pieces
of code in your project, by allowing you to intercept and fake the
behavior of almost any C/ C++ code.

`Learn more about Isolator++ or download a free
trial <http://www.typemock.com/isolatorpp-product-page>`_.
