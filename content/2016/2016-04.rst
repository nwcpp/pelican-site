Abstract
~~~~~~~~
With the direction in developing hardware with more processing power, caching of data and power efficiency, it is necessary to review the complete ecosphere of processing threads in a multithreaded environment. What will be presented is a look at this ecosphere and a way to utilize a proposed STL to handle complex threading problems to be more computationally efficient.
