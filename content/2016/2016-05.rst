Abstract
~~~~~~~~
“Modules” are a frequently requested and long-awaited feature by C++ programmers.  The basic idea is a direct language support for (a) expressing the boundaries and dependencies of program components; (b) isolating source codes from macro vagaries; (c) scaling compile time, especially for large projects, given the ubiquity of “headers-only” template libraries; (d) spur innovation and deployment of semantics-aware developer tools.  I will give an overview of the design points, goals, with emphasis on how modules address the four major problems mentioned above.  I will also address standardization process and implementation issues.
