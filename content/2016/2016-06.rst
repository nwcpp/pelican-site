Abstract
~~~~~~~~
LIQUiD provides a modular software architecture for the simulation of quantum algorithms. It provides a high level interface and is independent of a specific quantum architecture. Recently we’ve released LIQUiD to the public for academic use. It is a free package that runs on Windows, Linux and OSX as a provided executable with built-in examples and sample scripts as well as a development environment (using Visual Studio or mono, also freely available) that allows the user to compile their own quantum algorithms into an executable. The package includes a 100 page User’s Manual as well as over 700 pages of API documentation. This talk will cover the basics of Quantum Computing as well as an overview of the simulator and its applications. See: http://StationQ.github.io/Liquid if you’d like to “kick the tires” beforehand.

Bio
~~~
Martin Rotteler of Microsoft Research, Martin Roetteler received a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Karlsruhe, Germany, in 2001. Subsequently, from 2003-2004 he held a post-doc position at the Institute for Quantum Computing from at U Waterloo. From 2005 on, he was a Research Staff Member with NEC Laboratories America. From 2007-2013 he was the leader of NEC's Quantum IT group in Princeton.  In 2013, Martin joined Microsoft Research in Redmond as a Senior Researcher.  He worked on projects funded by ARO, NSA, the European Union, the German DFG, and he was the PI of the IARPA QCS project TORQUE, a joint effort between Raytheon/BBN Technologies, NEC Labs America, U Waterloo, and U Melbourne. Martin's research focuses on quantum algorithms, quantum programming languages, and quantum error-correction.
