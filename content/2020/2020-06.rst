Title
~~~~~
Remedial C++ 14

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
This is the sequel to the Remedial C++ 11 talk.  Come to see what new features we got with C++14 that were not available before.

Here's a link in case you want to watch the `Remedial C++ 11 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1zNN_U6tEQ&feature=youtu.be>`_ talk beforehand.  

Speaker Bio
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Like the man in black said: "No one of consequence". Peter Williamson has been programming professionally for 30 years at companies like Boeing, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google. He’s been using C++ for most of that time, and attending NWCPP off and on since the 90’s. He has been known to talk about himself in third person.
