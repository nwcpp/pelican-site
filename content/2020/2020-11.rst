Title
~~~~~
3D Graphics for Dummies

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
An introduction to Three Dimensional Graphics: Points, Vectors, Matrix Math, Rasterization and the methods used in the Graphics Pipeline and Rendering. Being a typical engineer, rather than just using an off-the-shelf library, I wrote a simple program to explore the blood and guts of the topic. It is much simpler than you would think.

Speaker Bio
~~~~~~~~~~~
Chris Ryan was classically trained in both software and hardware engineering.  He is well experienced in Modern C++ & Classic 'C', on extremely large/complex problem spaces and on Embedded/Firmware devices (large & small). Chris has no interest in C#, Java, js or any web-ish tech.
