What's New in Visual Studio for C++ Developers

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
Are you making the most of what Visual Studio can do? This session will cover C++ improvements from the past year, including code navigation, Build Insights, and native support for Unreal Engine.
With the rapid growth of AI tooling, GitHub Copilot has also evolved to better support developers. This presentation will cover updates to GitHub Copilot, including its two key interfaces in
Visual Studio: Copilot Chat and editor suggestions, along with how Copilot integrates with other parts of the IDE.
Weâ€™ll also explore C++ Dynamic Debugging, a new capability that lets you debug optimized code as if it were unoptimized, so you can diagnose issues in high-performance builds without sacrificing speed.
This session will be demo-driven, showcasing these features and improvements through real-world examples that demonstrate how they can enhance your everyday development workflow.

Speaker Bio

Mryam Girmay of Microsoft will be presenting. Additional detail coming soon!
