Title
~~~~~
Lightning Talks!!!

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
This month will be an open forum for a series of lightning talks. Each talk should be 5-10 minutes in length. If you would like to give a talk, simply show up to the meeting!
At the start of the meeting we'll collect a list of talks and then dive in! This is intended to be an opportunity for folks to present on subjects that may not be large enough for an hour long presentation.
