<ul>
  <li> Helping
</li>
  <ul>
    <li> The thread that conflicts with another transaction tries to help the other one
</li>
    <ul>
      <li> If the other is not SUCCESSFUL yet, abort it
</li>
      <li> Otherwise, help update orecs
</li>
    </ul>
    <li> It does it by going through the other transaction's descriptor and doing the writes
</li>
    <li> But it cannot release ownership of orecs because the first thread will still try to use them
</li>
    <li> It builds a combined descriptor for both trying to linearize the two transactions
</li>
    <ul>
      <li> If the records conflict, this transaction aborts
</li>
      <li> Otherwise it steals the transaction record
</li>
    </ul>
    <li> The other transaction finds out that the record is stolen and it helps the first one
</li>
    <li> This scheme requires adding a counter to orecs and doing double-word CAS
</li>
    <li> Another option is to go through the operating system (acquiring a suspension lock)
</li>
