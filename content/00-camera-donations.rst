The bulk of the feedback we have received over the last year
on the videotaping of our meetings
has been that the sound quality is very poor.
To address this issue, the club would like to purchase a new video camera
that will allow us to use a remote microphone for the speaker.
The Northwest C++ Users’ Group is currently collecting donations
to fund a new camera to record our meetings.
Ideally we would like to collect $700 to purchase the following:

-  new HD video camera, $400
-  wireless microphone for the presenter, $150
-  tripod, $100
-  camera bag, $50

This equipment will be used to improve the quality of the recordings for our monthly meetings,
in particular the sound quality.
The videos of our meetings will continue to be posted
on our `Vimeo channel <http://vimeo.com/nwcpp>`_
so those who cannot attend our meeting in person
can still benefit from our speaker presentations.

Watch our president, Lloyd Moore, `announce our fundraiser <https://vimeo.com/55217359>`_.
