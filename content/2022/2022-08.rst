Title
~~~~~
Building a C/C++ Infrared Piano

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
TinkerForge provides a variety of sensors and devices: an air quality sensor, analog joystick, linear potentiometer, speaker, LCD screen, infrared distance sensor, and many more. We’ve used some of these devices to create an infrared piano. Two IR sensors detect where you place your hand over two sets of keys. The speaker beeps at a frequency matching the note for that key. The LCD prints the distance detected by each IR sensor. And the linear potentiometer controls volume. The software that runs the piano uses TinkerForge’s C/C++ API bindings. These are easy to retrieve from ConanCenter using the Conan C/C++ package manager. This session examines the various sensors, devices, and codes used to create the piano. You’ll go behind the scenes of the piano’s development, and its iterations, and see how you can start creating similar projects.
