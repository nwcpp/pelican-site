Title
~~~~~
Open Discussion: Why So Many Languages?

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
Hi Folks - we are going to try something new this month. In lieu of a speaker we are going to hold an open discussion on the topic of "Why So Many Languages?" This will be a "free form" discussion, some general questions to kick things off could be:
1. Is there really a need for so many languages?
2. Does the availability of so many languages help or hurt the development process?
3. Does the availability of so many languages reduce or increase the cost of a project?
4. With so many languages to work with can you ever really learn one in depth?
