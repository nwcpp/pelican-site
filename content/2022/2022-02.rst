Title
~~~~~
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love C++ 20

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
Over the last few months, I have been working on updating my C++ course materials with topics from C++ 20, as well as drafting chapters for a book on modern C++ for finance.  In this presentation, I thought I would share some of what I've learned about C++ 20.  The emphasis will be on a broad range of highlights such as modules, mathematical constants, ranges, views, concepts, and the new date class, along with a few examples of practical applications.

Speaker Bio
~~~~~~~~~~~
Daniel Hanson is a full-time lecturer in the Computational Finance & Risk Management program within the Department of Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington. His appointment followed over 25 years of experience in private sector quantitative development in finance and data science.
