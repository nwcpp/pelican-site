Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Debugging real time issues
present a unique set of challenges and requirements to the developer.
Normal debugging techniques such as breakpoints, printf statements, and logging
frequently fail to locate the problem and can actually make the issue worse.
This presentation will examine why common debugging techniques fail
when applied to real time issues,
and then present tools and techniques
which can successfully address the unique challenges of real time debugging.
