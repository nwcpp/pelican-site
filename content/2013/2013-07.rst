Abstract
~~~~~~~~

To help address the confusion that arises
when rvalue references become lvalue references through reference collapsing,
Scott Meyers introduced the notion of "universal references."
In this presentation, he builds on this foundation
by explaining that overloading functions on rvalue references is sensible and useful,
while seemingly similar overloading on universal references
yields confusing, unhelpful behavior.
But what do you do when you want to write a perfect forwarding function
(which requires universal references),
yet you want to customize its behavior for certain types?
If overloading is off the table, what's on?
In this talk, Scott surveys a variety of options.

Though Scott will give a one-slide overview
of the idea behind universal references at the beginning of the presentation,
attendees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the notion
in more detail prior to the talk.
