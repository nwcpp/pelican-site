Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Play and be productive with modern C++, graphics, on-the-fly projects and more!
Starting from the latest
`Going Native 2013 <http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013>`_
talks as an inspiration,
we will explore how easy is to mold ideas into graphics apps
with C++ and `Cinder <http://libcinder.org/>`_,
and how simple tools and techniques can help us be more productive in Visual Studio!
