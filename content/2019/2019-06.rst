Title
~~~~~
Intro to programming the HyperFlow computational array using C++

Abstract
~~~~~~~~
HyperFlow is a new computing architecture being developed to address the FPGA and Data Center compute markets that will provide massive performance capabilities of an FPGA while being nearly as easy to program as a multi-core CPU.  HyperFlowâ€™s primary (only) programming mechanism is C++. This talk will provide an introduction to the architecture, discuss the compilation process (which uses Clang/LLVM), and provide insights into C++ programming techniques to take advantage of the inherent performance.

Speaker Bio
~~~~~~~~~~~
Paul Hylander is CEO at Hyper Analytix and the lead architect of the VLSI architecture, compiler, and C++ libraries associated with HyperFlow.  Paul has been working in the fields of microprocessor design, SOC design/verification, VLSI architectures and circuit design, and software development since 1994.
