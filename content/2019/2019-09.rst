Title
~~~~~
NO MEETING THIS MONTH!!!

Our normal meeting time this month overlaps with CppCon AND our speaker for the alternate meeting time had a last minute conflict. Because of these we'll skip the meeting this month.

Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Also if you are REALLY looking for your C++ fix this month here are some on-line resources to keep you going:

`CppCon Website <https://cppcon.org/>`_
`CppNow Videos <http://cppnow.org/history/2019/talks/>`_
`CppCast <https://cppcast.com/>`_

Enjoy and we'll see you in October at our normal meeting time!
