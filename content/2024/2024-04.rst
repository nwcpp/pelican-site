Title
~~~~~
Modern C++ package management with Conan 2: From fully transparent CMake integration via providers to the latest research in Common Package Specification (CPS) 

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~

Conan 2.0 was released over a year ago with a large number of new features and improvements. Since its release, the team has continued to add improvements based on user feedback,
releasing many more new features than in the previous years combined. 

This talk will introduce and demonstrate many exciting and new features like how CMake presets and dependency providers can give a fully transparent integration, the new interactive
dependency graph visualization, using dependencies from a git repo and new compliance tools. It will also present ongoing work and current efforts in the Common Package Specification (CPS) initiative.
