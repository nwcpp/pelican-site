Title
~~~~~
CUDA Tooling & Basic Optimizations

Abstract
~~~~~~~~~
We’re going to pick up where last month’s “CUDA Without a PhD” left off (watch the recording in case you missed it, since we’re going to build on top of Lloyd’s excellent introduction to CUDA).
This time, we’ll take a deeper look into NVIDIA’s CUDA toolchain, including the compiler, debugger, profiler(s), sanitizers and more. Using these tools, we’ll introduce a few basic ideas around
optimizing CUDA applications.

Speaker Bio
~~~~~~~~~~~
By day, Leonard Mosescu is exploring next-generation compilation technologies and programming models at NVIDIA. By night, he’s pursuing an old interest in AI and Evolutionary Algorithms.
