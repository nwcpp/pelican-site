Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Wouldn't it be great if you could have the compiler help you navigate
the murky waters of multithreaded programming? This talk delves into the
under explored issue of volatile-correctness. The exciting discovery is
- if you follow a couple of simple rules in conjunction with the
volatile keyword, you can transform all race conditions into
compile-time errors.
