Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Christian Harlass works with Saxonia Systems, an international
consulting company based in Germany. He works as a software developer
and project manager in a Unix, Mac and Windows environment. The idea for
this presentation comes from his project experiences with creating a
portable application with a Java GUI and a C++ core.
