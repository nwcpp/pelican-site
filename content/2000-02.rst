Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Tom, a NWCPP member, will introduce his company, Intuitive Edge Corp.,
and Datatypes++, Intuitive Edge's first product. Datatypes++ is a C++
class library for Windows that extends C++'s datatypes to text, exact
numeric, date, time, binary, bitset and others. Tom will start by
covering the process of starting a software company and the evolution of
the company's accomplishments and goals. The primary body of the talk
will focus on dreaming up an idea for a software product and bringing it
to market. Tom encourages members to download the beta 1 version of
Datatypes++ from the Intuitive Edge Web site , www.IntuitiveEdge.com.
This way, he can field specific questions about the product and the
design decisions he has made about the product.
