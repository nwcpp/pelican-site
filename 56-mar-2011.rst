-------------------------------------------------

Come at 6:30pm to socialize and eat pizza provided by
`Summit Group Solutions <http://www.summitgroupsolutions.com/>`_!

**Abstract:** Debuggers are an important tool for helping software engineers
get to the root of certain problems.
`Mago <http://dsource.org/projects/mago_debugger>`_ 
s a graphical debugger dedicated to the
`D programming language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D_(programming_language)>`_
on Windows.
It is made up of several independent libraries that can be used
for other purposes such as tracing and code analysis.

In this talk, we'll cover the process of debugging in general,
specifics on Windows, and details about Mago's connection to D.

**Speaker Bio:** Aldo Nunez has worked on embedded software since
graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science from New York University in 2001.
He first programmed BASIC on the VTech PreComputer 1000,
and is interested in programming language tools and video games.
