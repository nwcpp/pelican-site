&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of writing reusable software is as old as programming,
and is so well ingrained into programmers that we take it as an axiom.
It&amp;#8217;s accepted, and non-controversial.
Of course we all strive to produce reusable software;
after all, we&amp;#8217;re professionals.
But as I look back on 35 years of programming,
I note with chagrin that practically none of the code I&amp;#8217;ve written
has been usable in another project.
I will &amp;#8216;reuse&amp;#8217; code by copy-paste-modify, but that&amp;#8217;s cheating,
and even that doesn&amp;#8217;t happen too often.
Somehow, I seemed to have missed the boat somewhere.
I ask other long-time programmers,
and they seem to have the same frustrating experience.
This starts out, then, as a journey into figuring out what went wrong.
Why does that hash table I wrote before not work in another project?
Why is my macro expander not reusable?
Why did I chuck all my carefully written &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTF&lt;/span&gt; code?
Why do I write symbol tables over (and over again)?
Why is that disassembler I wrote completely unusable in another application?
Why do I keep reinventing the&amp;nbsp;wheel?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk tries to answer that question,
and delves into how component programming works
and how it can address code&amp;nbsp;reusability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.walterbright.com/"&gt;Walter Bright&lt;/a&gt;
is the creator and first implementer of the D programming language
and has implemented compilers for several other languages.
He&amp;#8217;s an expert in all areas of compiler technology,
including front ends, optimizers, code generation,
interpreter engines, and runtime libraries.
Walter regularly writes articles about compilers and programming,
is known for engaging and informative presentations,
and provides training in compiler development techniques.
Many are surprised to discover that
Walter is also the creator of the wargame Empire,
which is still popular today over 30 years after its&amp;nbsp;debut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A robust reflection/metadata system in C++ can be extremely powerful
and has many applications, particularly in game programming.
It can facilitate sophisticated debug output and logging,
trivial factory implementation,
automatic serialization and deserialization for any arbitrary object,
automatic binding to a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; system,
and even automatic binding of objects and functions to a scripting language
(both Lua and Python are popular).
The typeinfo/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RTTI&lt;/span&gt; system currently in C++ however
is simply not up to this level of functionality,
so a more sophisticated solution is necessary.
In this talk, I will implement a simple, yet powerful, meta reflection system in C++,
completely from scratch,
and using test-driven development.
I will also show how I leverage a similar system in my own game engine.
Finally, I promise there will be no more than three PowerPoint&amp;nbsp;slides.&lt;/p&gt;
