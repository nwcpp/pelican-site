&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concepts_(C%2B%2B)"&gt;C++ Concepts&lt;/a&gt;
got a lot of bad press and were dropped from
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x"&gt;C++0x&lt;/a&gt;.
They were considered too complex with too few benefits.
And yet their equivalent in Haskell,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class"&gt;type classes&lt;/a&gt;,
are considered simple and powerful.
I will talk about both languages, explaining some Haskell and C++ concept syntax as I go.
I'll give examples of problems that type classes solve and C++ concepts could have solved.
I'll show you the hair-raising forensics of a C++ ADL
(Argument-Dependent Lookup) mishap that could have been avoided by using concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bartosz Milewski has a Ph.D. in High-Energy Physics
and many years of experience as a C++ programmer.
He worked at Microsoft on the Context Index—a search engine before the Internet,
still an active part of Windows 7.
He designed the first distributed version control system,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.relisoft.com/co_op/"&gt;Code Co-op&lt;/a&gt;
(before BitKeeper and Git).
Bartosz took part in the design of the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/"&gt;D language&lt;/a&gt;.
His main topics of interest are concurrent and distributed computing and language design.
He regularly publishes a blog at
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://BartoszMilewski.wordpress.com"&gt;http://BartoszMilewski.wordpress.com&lt;/a&gt;.
You may see him occasionally at CSE 950 P at the UW.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern IDEs and compilers generate a wealth of information,
and you can't have any of it.
Tools in the compiler family — even the best IDEs — tend to be monolithic, language-specific,
generally non-scalable special-purpose applications.
Even when they do support headless analysis, none of them do it the same way,
and very few of them can do cross-language analysis.
At Google, I've put together a team with the long-term goal of addressing these problems
in a general way.
We've built infrastructure to run IDE-quality code analyzers such
as &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang"&gt;clang&lt;/a&gt;
over Google's entire corpus and all open-source code.
We translate the intermediate representations into a language-neutral index,
then serve the index data back through language-neutral APIs and query interfaces.
In this talk I'll share what we've done so far,
then about our longer-term plans for an open platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many mainstream programming paradigms —
imperative, object oriented, meta, functional, etc.
Each has their proponents and languages oriented around it.
But larger applications tend to not fit easily into any particular paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In extreme cases, developers will resort to using multiple languages
with an uneasy interface between them.
The &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.digitalmars.com/d/index.html"&gt;D programming language&lt;/a&gt;
takes a different approach, offering multiple programming paradigms within one language,
making it easy to select the most suitable paradigm for each task within the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GigaFlops or… TerraFlops?
The modern GPU is a massively parallel supercomputer
that has 2 orders of magnitude more processing power than a single CPU Core.
But the threading model is very different than the CPU.
Don’t get left behind on knowing about this different paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Bio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gavriel Plotke, Microsoft Senior SDET.
I've been with Microsoft for 3 years on the DirectX High Level Shader Language compiler test team.
I’ve been a champion of the new Compute Shader features of DirectX11.
While I have some graphics background,
it was my assembler language and compiler writing background that got me the job.
Early in my career I worked on the internals of
a mainframe spreadsheet product as a competitor to VisiCalc and Lotus123.
It was a time when everyone in a big office would have a mainframe terminal and
no one had a PC.
It was a great product, but time moved on, and Excel on inexpensive PCs ate our lunch.
After that I spent many years doing business contract work
— different projects, different platforms, lots of database design.
Now I help support programming on today’s supercomputer, the modern graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message passing paradigm makes multithreaded programming safer.
In this talk I'll be trying to get to the bottom of message passing--
finding low level primitives from which a variety of message queues or
mailboxes may be built.
I'll make a few digressions into Haskell's MVars and OCaml's channels,
but mainly I'll talk about C++.
I'll show you how to separate synchronization from message storage
for a composable and type-safe system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="abstract"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why wait for the C++ committee to finish the specification when you can
enjoy much of the power of C++0x today!
C++0x, the next C++ standard, is almost upon us
and it contains the most important updates to the language since the mid-90s.
It even accepts the existence of multiple threads for the first time in the language’s history.
Needless to say, these new features bring more expressiveness and power to the native C++ developer.
Visual Studio 2010 has added support for some of these key features
in order to enable these modern programming techniques.
This talk will clarify what features are in Visual C++ 2010 and what is yet to come.
It will illustrate how new constructs such as lambda expressions
enable better use of existing libraries
and how your code can be simpler, safer and faster all at the same time.
If you are itching to show off how C++ is one of the coolest languages on the planet,
this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

while enhancing the accuracy and performance of intellisense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163340.aspx"&gt;TPS&lt;/a&gt; is a
.NET library that allows the programmer to parallelize fragments of
code. Haskell support for parallelization goes deeper into the runtime.
Of course these are apples and oranges;
Haskell is a functional language, TPS is mostly used from C#.
But the implementation details are similar (both projects come from Microsoft Research).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="id1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When shared data is read frequently, but seldom modified,
the lock can become a bottleneck.
Callers are serialized on the lock and the memory underlying the lock
sloshes between different processor caches.
Since the data is rarely modified,
it seems like we should be able to read it without taking a lock at all.
This talk presents a safe, lock-free way to access shared data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://bartoszmilewski.wordpress.com/2009/03/03/broken-promises-c0x-futures/"&gt;“futures.”&lt;/a&gt;
In general, “futures” are a programming language abstraction for data
that will be produced asynchronously by other threads. We will discuss
the conceptual benefits to programming with futures vs. other
synchronization mechanisms, and show which techniques can be used in C++
and how they make concurrent APIs easier to consume.&lt;/p&gt;
