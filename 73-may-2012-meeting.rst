May 16, 2012: An Introduction to Microsoft’s C++ Accelerated Massive Parallelism – Don McCrady
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Come at 6:45 for pizza sponsored by `Randstad Technologies <http://technologies.randstadusa.com/>`_.

Microsoft’s C++ AMP (`Accelerated Massive Parallelism
<http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh265136(v=vs.110).aspx>`_)
is a C++ programming model and language extension that allows any C++ developer
to take advantage of the massive parallelism available in today’s GPU’s.
It offers a developer-friendly, lightweight, and portable interface
that can enable programmers to achieve impressive performance boosts
on a variety of hardware platforms.
As an integrated part of Visual C++,
it is also supported by a full suite of familiar developer tools
including the editor, debugger, and profiler.
This presentation will introduce C++ AMP
and talk about its projected future as the hardware ecosystem evolves.
