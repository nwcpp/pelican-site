Feb 16, 2011: The Thought Process of Patterns: Essential Design Skills – Alan Shalloway
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pizza will be supplied by `Net Objectives <http://www.netobjectives.com/>`_

Patterns have been known as “Solutions to Recurring Problems in  a Context.”
However, they are really more than just that.
In fact, Christopher Alexander, the inspirer of design patterns in general and
the author of this quote later says at the end of his book
– “At this final stage, the patterns are no longer important:
the patterns have taught you to be receptive to what is real.”
This talk is about the thought process of patterns – what to be receptive to.
These concepts will be discussed in the context of emerging application architectures
and so will be of particular interest to agile developers.
However, these concepts are equally important to creating designs that are to endure,
regardless of the methodology involved.

The lessons learned will be taken from Net Objectives’ upcoming book
`Essential Skills for the Agile Developer
<http://www.netobjectives.com/resources/books/essential-skills-agile-developers>`_:

-  Programming by Intention
-  Separating Use from  Construction
-  Define tests Up Front
-  Shalloway’s Law
-  Encapsulate That

Attendees will learn a new respect for design patterns
and how they are more useful today than ever before.
